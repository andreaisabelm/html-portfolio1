<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a life-long learner my goal has always been to continuosly grow and find the necessary tools to learn the things that interest me. A
   along the way, I have been able to adapt my new found passions with my already refined skills. I began my career by studying psychology
   not certain if therapy or counseling would be an option for my very sensitive empath heart, I decided to embark on the journey as I believed
   I would be learning things that benefit me regardless of my choices later in the future. To understand human behavior, to look at things in
   a scientific way, be very critical about my choices and the biases that sometimes guide my choices. This would become instrumental in my 
    journey, dealing with people, employees, students, bosses, everything. </p>

<p>Now I'm embarking a new journey, programming. This one is a little scarier, but again my passion for learning has made me 
   incinvible against the enemy of starting from 0. Of feeling like a beginner, of stuggling, failing and doubts. It's all part of it. 
</p>

<p>Laslty there's my fear of leaving one of my passions aside. Teaching. But in my discoveries I have learned that it can always be a part
   of my life, and that even better with my new found love for technology, teaching can be more impactful than it was before.
   In my country, the land of no opportunities, I see technology as a springboard for many passionate and dedicated young people. 
   In a country where knowing people gets you places, while maintaining our very visible inequality, technology serves as an equalizer. 
   We don't care who your family is or if you know me from before? Can you code and can you do it today? The benefits are endless.</p>
